    <h1>THE FROGS AND THE OX </h1>
    <img src="images/Story_2_img.jpg">
    <p>An Ox came down to a reedy pool to
drink. As he splashed heavily into the
water, he crushed a young Frog into the
mud. The old Frog soon missed the little
one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him. "A great big monster,"
said one of them, "stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!" "Big, was he!"
said the old Frog, puffng herself up. "Was he as big as this?" "Oh, much bigger!" they
cried. The Frog puffed up still more.
"He could not have been bigger than this," she said. But the little Frogs all declared
that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffng herself out
more and more until, all at once, she burst.
