    <h1>THE KID AND THE WOLF</h1>
    <img src="images/Story_4_img.jpg">
    <p>A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep
        shelter to keep him out of harm's way. The Kid was browsing near the edge of the roof,
        when he spied a Wolf and began to jeer at him, making faces and abusing him to his
        heart's content.
        "I hear you," said the Wolf, "and I haven't the least grudge against you for what you
        say or do. When you are up there it is the roof that's talking, not you." </p>
        <h3>Moral: Do not say anything at any time that you would not say at all times. </h3>
